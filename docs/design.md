# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Inventory Listing System**

Project Author: **Torrian Kinred-Harding**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Owners of second-hand stores have a very messy and chaotic inventory by nature, making it hard to know everything they have in store. Having a system that tracked their inventory would decrease the need to browse the store manually.

### End-User Requirements

My end user will only be one person, who has moderate IT skills. Therefore, i will need to make sure that the UI is simple and intuitive to use without any major complexity.

### Proposed Solution

This system will be able to:

* Show a list of items on the main page and their category

* show individual categories and all the items that belong to them

* Add items to the list

* Add categories to the database which new items can be listed under

* Remove items from the list

-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability of a system is how easy/difficult it is for users to make the system do it's intended purpose.

I will need to design my system to be as usable as possible since the main client (the shop owner) of the second-hand shop may not have advanced IT skills. Any customers that use the website could also have a wide range of IT skills. I need to ensure that the system is usable for people, even if they arenâ€™t skilled with IT.

I will make sure that the system is intuitive to understand by removing unnecessary details and making simple basic functions to use the site.

### Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a system relate to how it looks in terms of design.

I should include aesthetic considerations when i design the system UI because a pleasantly designed interface is much more enjoyable to use than a badly designed one(clashing colours, etc.). This is especially important because several customers might be using the website, so the appearance has more importance than if it was just the shop owner using the site.

I will need to try and make the website User Interface visually apealling.

### End-users

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

It is very important that i ensure the end product fulfils the shop owner's requirements (being able to digitally record inventory), because that is the entire purpose of the website system.

I will ask the client whether the finished product meets their expectations and requirements.

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a system relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

I need to make my system work properly, with no major errors or bugs. This is absolutely necessary because a non-functional website cannot be used.

I will make sure my website works as intended, with no major bugs or errors.

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

Database schema here: ![Database schema](images/databaseschema.png)


### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

In general, the site meets the needs of the user. 
Additionally, the system is fairly simple to use, which suits the IT skill of the client.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.

### Review of End-Users

In the end, the site did meet the needs of the client. The site can: Show a list of items on the main page and their category, show individual categories and all the items that belong to them, add items to the list, add categories to the database which new items can be listed under, and remove items from the list. The needs of the user have been met. 

This image shows a list of items and the category they belong to, as well as the ability to delete items ![alt text](images/uipicture.png)
Accompany the notes with screenshots / other media to illustrate specific features.

### Review of Aesthetics

In the final product, this relevant implication was ignored to a degree. This is because the client decided that they would be the only one to use the site, meaning that aesthetics were less important because no customers would be seeing the site. Accompany the notes with screenshots / other media to illustrate specific features.

### Review of Usability

In terms of usability, the site is mostly simple and intuitive to understand. Buttons do what people would expect them to do, and so on.

This picture shows the home button in the top right corner, and the items in the middle of the page. Pressing 'see category' brings you to a list of every item in that category, and pressing 'delete item' does exactly that.
