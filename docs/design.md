# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Inventory Listing System**

Project Author: **Torrian Kinred-Harding**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Owners of second-hand stores have a very messy and chaotic inventory by nature, making it hard to know everything they have in store. Having a system that tracked their inventory would decrease the need to check the store manually.

### End-User Requirements

My end user will only be one person, who has moderate IT skills.therefore, i will need to make sure that the UI is simple and intuitive to use without any major complexity.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.


-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability of a system is how easy/difficult it is for users to make the system do it's intended purpose.

I will need to design my system to be as usable as possible since the main client (the shop owner) of the second-hand shop may not have advanced IT skills. Any customers that use the website could also have a wide range of IT skills. I need to ensure that the system is usable for people, even if they arenâ€™t skilled with IT.

I will make sure that the system is intuitive to understand by removing unnecessary details and making simple basic functions to use the site.

### Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a system relate to how it looks in terms of design.

I should include aesthetic considerations when i design the system UI because a pleasantly designed interface is much more enjoyable to use than a badly designed one(clashing colours, etc.). This is especially important because several customers might be using the website, so the appearance has more importance than if it was just the shop owner using the site.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

### End-users

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

It is very important that i ensure the end product fulfils the shop owner's requirements (being able to digitally record inventory), because that is the entire purpose of the website system.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a system relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

I need to make my system work properly, with no major errors or bugs.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.


-------------------------------------------------## Final System Design

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *final design* of your database: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place images here that show your *final design* of your UI: layout, colours, etc.


-------------------------------------------------

## Completed System

### Database Structure

Place a image here that shows the *actual database structure* that you implemented: tables, fields and relationships.

### User Interface Design

Place screenshots and notes here that show your *actual system UI* in action.


-------------------------------------------------

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
